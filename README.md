# Build-a-burrito-dashboard-using-atoti
The objective of this project is to perform data analysis on burrito sales and location reviews to gain insights into burrito specifications and customer preferences across different locations. 
 By leveraging data analysis techniques, we aim to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations that can help businesses make data-driven decisions related to burrito offerings and location strategies.
 ## The Project involves : 
 1) Data Collection: Gather data on burrito sales, location information, and customer reviews. This data may include variables such as burrito specifications (e.g., circumference, volume, length, mass, cost), sales figures, geographical location, and customer ratings.

2)Data Preprocessing: Cleanse and preprocess the collected data. This step involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and performing any necessary data transformations or feature engineering.

3) Exploratory Data Analysis: Conduct exploratory data analysis to gain initial insights into the dataset. This may involve generating summary statistics, visualizations, and performing descriptive analysis to understand the distribution of burrito specifications, sales patterns, and location reviews.

4) Burrito Specification Analysis: Analyze the burrito specifications to identify any notable trends or preferences. This analysis may involve examining relationships between burrito specifications (e.g., circumference, volume, length, mass, cost) and sales figures or customer ratings. Statistical techniques such as correlation analysis or regression analysis can be employed to quantify the relationships between variables.

5) Location Analysis: Explore the location data and customer reviews to understand the impact of location on burrito sales and customer satisfaction. This analysis may involve comparing sales performance and customer ratings across different locations, identifying key factors influencing customer satisfaction, and evaluating the potential for location-based recommendations or improvements.

6) Visualization and Reporting: Present the findings of the analysis using visualizations such as charts, graphs, and maps. Create informative reports summarizing the key insights obtained from the data analysis, including recommendations for burrito specifications and location strategies.
